# Framework

A personal project in practical metaphysics.

This repository contains the source code for [framework.antonyotero.com](framework.antonyotero.com)
, where I am developing and sharing a system of thought and practice. The framework is not abstract philosophy alone; it is an attempt to live consciously, carry responsibility, and forge meaning where none is given.

## Status

🚧 Early stage / under construction

🌱 Beginning with notes, blog entries, and core principles

⚓️ A seed project started before Navy RTC

## Guiding Ideas

Conscious Responsibility — to live is to carry weight willingly.

Integration — harmonizing life’s spheres rather than compartmentalizing them.

Courage & Honor — coherence between what we know and how we act.

Humility in Transcendence — no framework is final; this one must remain open.

## Roadmap

 Publish initial blog posts (seed concepts)

 Expand into structured sections (principles, practices, reflections)

 Integrate into broader personal site
