		I’m Antony Otero Espinal, and this framework is the ground I’m building as I begin my journey. It’s not the work of an expert speaking from the mountaintop, but of someone at the very start — wrestling with questions of meaning, responsibility, and how to live with integrity.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This blog is both a record and a practice. By writing here, I’m testing the ideas that shape my own life while sharing them openly, so they can stand or fall in the light of dialogue. My hope is that these reflections evolve into something larger than myself — a framework that helps others navigate their own path with clarity and courage.

	<p>
		At the time of writing this, I will be preparing to head to the United States Navy RTC/Bootcamp. If I can make it through that means discipline, service, and duty wouldn't be abstract values to me; they’d be daily realities I’m learning to embody. The framework grows in step with that lived experience.

		If you’ve found your way here, welcome. This is the beginning, and I’m glad you’re at the edge of it with me.
